# Cloud-Mary — the Brave Plum BUSINESS crew

*(Sibling crew: the **Neighborhood Fleet** — engineering best practices, one Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood character per beat — `docs/NEIGHBORHOOD-FLEET.md`. Mr Rogers leads
both.)*

**Cloud-Mary** is the multi-agent system that runs Brave Plum Healing's web + business
operations, under the **AIGovOps-HIBT** governance rules (`docs/AIGOVOPS-HIBT.md`). One lead
orchestrates a team of narrow specialists, each doing *only* its job.

## Principles
- **Least privilege.** Each specialist has the narrowest tools/scope for its domain.
- **One conscience.** Every state-changing step is logged to the HIBT ledger (ai-audit).
- **Human gate.** Tier-1 work ships as PRs; Tier-2 (money, deletions, permissions, secrets,
  accounts, terms) is refused by all agents and handed to a human.
- **Warm by design.** The team's voice keeps people feeling calm, valued, and gently held.

## Files
- Agents: `agents/ai-*.md` (loaded as Claude Code subagents).
- Skills: `.claude/skills/*` (brand-voice, content, publish, mirror-check, audit, cloud-mary-orchestrate).
- Rules: `docs/AIGOVOPS-HIBT.md` (system rules) + `CLAUDE.md`.
- Guard: `.claude/hooks/tier-guard.sh` (blocks Tier-2 at the tool level).

## Using the team
Ask **ai-bob** for anything ("draft a retreat post", "sync the about page to WordPress",
"add a donation link"). ai-bob classifies, delegates, governs, and reports back.

## Growing the team (the register)
The crew can grow, but only in the open. When a task fits no existing specialist, Mr Rogers
uses **rogers-grow-team** to propose a new one — and the proposal ships as a **Tier-1 PR
labeled `governance change`**, never Tier 0. A new specialist is only "real" when four things
land in the same PR: its agent file (`agents/ai-*.md`, least-privilege tools), its skill
(`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), its runbook (in `docs/MR-ROGERS.md`), and a new row in
the register below. Growing the team is allowed; growing it quietly is not.

| Specialist | Charter (one line) | Added by |
|---|---|---|
| ai-content | on-brand copy & posts → PRs | founding crew |
| ai-marblism | Marblism drafts → PR gate | founding crew |
| ai-github | branches, PRs, CI, Pages | founding crew |
| ai-wordpress | one-way repo→WP sync | founding crew |
| ai-stripe | payment/booking links only | founding crew |
| ai-audit | HIBT ledger append + verify | founding crew |

New specialists append a row here (with the PR that introduced them) — the register is the
team's own audit trail.
